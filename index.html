      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm new to coding, but I pick things up quickly. Currently I'm working as a Field Service Engineer in the healthcare sector. I'm excited to meet the class and develop these new skills.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I have lived in multiple states, including Minnesota, Texas, California, and Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Elden ring is devouring my life. I have also played D&D for multiple years. I like to hike when I can and I've just started watching Sailor Moon.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't dream of labor. I'd like to work from home, though. Voice acting, or working for an indie game developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in an apartment in Kirkland, Washington with my wife and two cats.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I like to solve problems, and analyzing the literal inputs and outputs of code is something I think I will be very good at.</p>
