      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm new to this, but I pick things up pretty quickly. I might be a little strange and distant, but it just takes me a bit longer to feel comfortable around new people.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I come from all over the United States. Well, West of the Mississippi anyway.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Elden ring is devouring my life.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't dream of labor. I'd like to work from home, though.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in an apartment in Kirkland with my wife and two cats.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I like to solve problems, and analyzing the literal inputs and outputs of code is something I think I could be pretty good at.</p>
